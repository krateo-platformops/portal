"""Resolve every chart and image reference in a repository. Fail if any does not exist.

Four separate outages in this platform were the same defect: a pinned chart or image that
resolved to nothing. Each surfaced 30-45 minutes into a live cluster rebuild, as an opaque
ImagePullBackOff or a composition that reported Ready=True while deploying nothing. Each
would have taken seconds to catch here.

Deliberately regex-driven, not YAML-parsed: most of these files are Helm templates, so they
are not valid YAML, and the references live in printf blocks and doc comments as often as in
values. Matching text finds them all.

Exit 1 if any reference is unresolvable.
